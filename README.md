Suicide is a serious issue these days among teens. If one considers developed countries like the USA, suicide is the 10th leading cause of death. It's more prevalent in developing countries like Sri Lanka, India so on.  There are many mobile applications which secretly connect the victim with a therapist online, but suicidal activities aren't predictable. One major reason for the increase in suicide is the lack of attention, someone who can listen to the victim, someone who can pay attention to their emotions and give some confidence to the victim in the situation.  We are trying to solve this problem, by introducing a chatbot which actually learns one's behavior and accordingly acts. We have Slack, which displays nice words before the pages loads, this actually makes an impact on the person who is starting their day at work! Such small things can bring a huge impact.  The chatbot embeds some machine learning concepts and learns about its user. It sends out greetings to the user every day in a humane manner. During hard times, the person can actually chat with the bot and can get some motivation. We are doing a deep research on how we can identify/predict the victims based on the web search, history and apps being installed.
